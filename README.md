# Vanilla js Projects

Anyone else get the creeping feeling that they don't know js but rather they know bits of js that work with a framework? So rather building knowledge from the ground up, knowledge is being built top down on what works within a certain framework?

Anyways, rather than pushing a bunch of unfinished projects in their own repos, I'd rather house them inside this git repo and aim to finish smaller projects mainly using vanilla js as much as possible.
